     <h1>Climate Change</h1>
        <h2><mark>Introduction:</mark></h2>
            
        <p>Climate change is a major global challenge today, and the world is becoming more vulnerable to this change. Climate change refers to the changes in Earth’s climate condition. It describes the changes in the atmosphere which have taken place over a period, ranging from decades to millions of years. The recent report from the United Nations predicted that average global temperature could increase by 6˚ Celsius at the end of the century. Climate change has an adverse effect on the environment and ecosystem. With the help of this essay, students will get to know the causes and effects of climate change, and possible solutions. Also, they will be able to write essays on similar topics and can boost their writing skills.</p>
    <h2><mark>What Causes Climate Change?</mark></h2>
    <p>The Earth’s climate has always changed and evolved. Some of these changes have been due to natural causes such as volcanic eruptions, floods, forest fires etc., but quite a few of them are due to human activities. Human activities such as deforestation, burning fossil fuels, farming livestock etc., generate an enormous amount of greenhouse gases. This results in greenhouse effect and global warming which are the major causes for climate change.</p>
    <h2><mark>Effects of Climate Change:</mark></h2>
    <p>If the current situation of climate change continues in a similar manner then it will impact all forms of life on the earth. The earth temperature will rise, the monsoon patterns will change, sea levels will rise, and storms, volcanic eruptions and natural disasters will occur frequently. The biological and ecological balance of the earth will get disturbed. The environment will get polluted and humans will not be able to get fresh air to breath and fresh water to drink. Life on earth will come to an end.</p>
    <h2><mark>Steps to be Taken to Reduce Climate Change:</mark></h2>
    <p>The Government of India has taken many measures to improve the dire situation of Climate Change. The Ministry of Environment and Forests is the nodal agency for climate change issues in India. It has initiated several climate-friendly measures, particularly in the area of renewable energy. India took several steps and policy initiatives to create awareness about climate change, and help capacity building for adaptation measures. It has initiated a “Green India” programme under which various trees are planted to make the forest land more green and fertile.</p>
    <p>We need to follow the path of sustainable development to effectively address the concerns of climate change. We need to minimise the use of fossil fuels, which is the major cause for global warming. We must adopt alternative sources of energy, such as hydropower, solar and wind energy to make a progressive transition to clean energy. Mahatma Gandhi said that, “Earth provides enough to satisfy every man’s need, but not any man’s greed”. With this view, we must remodel our outlook and achieve the goal of sustainable development. By adoption of clean technologies, equitable distribution of resources and addressing the issues of equity and justice, we can make our developmental process more harmonious with nature.</p>

    <p>We hope students liked this essay on Climate Change and gathered useful information on this topic, so that they can write essays in their own words.</p>
